AFDP - Abstract Factory Design Pattern defines an abstract class for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete sub-classes. 

## How to implement AFDP

### Why & When to use AFDP
- You need the system to be independent of how objects are created, composed and represented
- You only want to expose interfaces, not implementations (e.g. proprietary library).
- The system needs to be configured with one of multiple families of objects.
