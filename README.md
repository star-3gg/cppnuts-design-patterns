## PDF Documentation 📓

There is a PDF version of the documentation located [here](doc/PDF/).

## Obsidian & UML 📐

This project uses the UML — Unified Modeling Language standard for documentation of the code architecture.
Obsidian is used as the main means of documentation.
`.md` Markdown files can be viewed directly on GitHub.
There is no need for you to install Obsidian in order to read it.
However, Obsidian will provide the best reading experience.

### Example Graphics 🖌️

Custom UML diagrams have been created for this project.
The graphics in the video are of low quality, improved graphics have been generated.
All UML diagrams can be found in the [UML folder](/doc/Obsidian/CPPNutsDesignPatterns/UML),
they look similar to this example diagram:
